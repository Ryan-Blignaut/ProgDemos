# Efficient Data Access with Proxy Pattern: Improving Performance and Security in a Large-Scale Application

A proxy is a design pattern that acts as a surrogate(substitute) for a real object, allowing it to be controlled or accessed in a more efficient or secure manner. When a client makes a request to a proxy, the proxy intercepts the request and performs additional operations before passing the request along to the real object. This can include caching, logging,
authentication, or other forms of access control. By using a proxy, the client can interact with the real object indirectly, reducing the cost of accessing or managing it directly.

Benefits:

- Improved performance: By using a proxy to cache frequently-accessed data or perform computationally-intensive operations, the overall performance of the application can be improved.
- Enhanced security: A proxy can provide an additional layer of security by enforcing access control policies, filtering requests, or encrypting data.
- Simplified code: By separating concerns and delegating responsibilities to a proxy, the codebase can be simplified and easier to maintain.
- Avoids duplication: By inheriting from objects which might be huge size and memory intensive. This in further increases the performance.

Downsides:

- Increased abstraction: Adding a proxy layer can make the code more complex and harder to debug.
- Potential for errors: If a proxy is not implemented correctly, it can introduce errors or vulnerabilities (Services accessed directly) into the system.
- Additional development time: Implementing a proxy can require additional development time and effort, especially if the proxy needs to be customized for a specific use case.
- Not a common pattern: The proxy pattern is not a common design pattern, and may not be familiar to all developers leading to confusion.
